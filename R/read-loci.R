#' Read MSI locus tables from CLC reports in tidy format
#'
#' @description
#' `read_loci` reads in the locus genotype tables from a CLC MSI report and
#' converts them into a tidy format for easier data analysis.
#'
#' @section Initial data format:
#' MSI reports exported from CLC contain information on the genotype of
#' each tested locus, however the data structure is difficult to work with.
#'
#' - The name of the locus marker is on one row
#' - The stability of the marker ("Stable" or "Unstable") is on the next row
#' - Then there is a genotype table including the repeat lengths of the locus and
#' the percentage of reads in the sample and baseline associated with each length.
#' - There is a gap of two rows before the same information for the next
#' marker, which may have different repeat lengths associated with it.
#'
#' @section What `read_loci` does:
#'
#' `read_loci` rearranges the initial format using 3 helper functions.
#'
#' - `read_msi_locus_section`: first, the section of the Excel sheet
#' containing the locus tables is read in as a single table.
#'
#' - `mutate_msi_row_numbers`: the numbers of each row are annotated.
#'
#' - `join_msi_locus_tables`: the three pieces of information for each marker (the name,
#' stability and repeat table) are joined together based on their row numbers
#' with : the marker name will be 2 rows above the repeat
#' table, and the marker stability will be 1 row above.
#'
#' @section Output data format:
#'
#' This produces a dataframe which includes the information in the repeat marker
#' table, with the marker name and stability as additional columns.
#'
#' @section Usage:
#'
#' `read-loci` can be combined with `purr::map` and `purrr::list_rbind` to
#' combine marker tables from multiple CLC MSI reports.
#'
#' @param filepath The filepath to the CLC MSI report Excel
#'
#' @returns A dataframe of locus information in tidy format.
#' @export
